# AdaIN Style Transfer

This project implements Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) for artistic style transfer using PyTorch.
AdaIN works by aligning the mean and variance of the content imageâ€™s features to those of a style image, allowing the content to adopt the style while preserving its structure.

The model was trained on Kaggle using content and style datasets, and the training process is demonstrated in my Kaggle notebook:
